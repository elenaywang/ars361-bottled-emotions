### *Overview:*      
This is a project I created for the ARS 361 Interactive Digital Multimedia class at Smith College. The purpose of this interactive art piece is to simplistically visualize the bottling up of emotions and the consequences of doing so. 

### *What this project does:*        
Click the "bottle" button to add metaphorical emotions to the bottle, and click the "release" button to remove emotions from the bottle. If the bottle has any amount of emotions in it, the amount will gradually and automatically grow. If the bottle completely fills up, the bottle will explode and the canvas will be deleted.

### *What I used:*     
The images were created in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. The code was written in JavaScript and uses the p5.js library.
