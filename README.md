# ars361-bottled-emotions

Project timeline: February 2022

This is a project I created for my ARS 361 Interactive Digital Multimedia class at Smith College. It uses p5.js.

The purpose of this interactive art piece is to simplistically visualize the bottling up of emotions. The images were created in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.
